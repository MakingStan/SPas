Use the master password as the key to encrypting your passwords and decrypting.
There is no way of checking if that password is correct. You just get an outcome.





------------how it works---------------
so the way this works is

user fills in masterpassword ->
masterpassword is used as key ->
encrypt/decrypt the data with aes which is symmetric. so you'll only need 1 secret key ->
done!
